(Note: Due to the current circumstances, "iq files" will substitute for the intended live radio challenge transmissions at UMDCTF. These files can be imported into various radio tools, and effectively simulate what you would've received during the in-person competition. All iq files can be found here)

For this challenge, you'll want to use RF3-MEMESTATION.iq and have GNUradio installed.

Have you ever wondered how cars know what the name of the song playing on the radio is? I sure have...

For this challenge, you'll also want to install a pre-existing gr-something tool to rx ;)
