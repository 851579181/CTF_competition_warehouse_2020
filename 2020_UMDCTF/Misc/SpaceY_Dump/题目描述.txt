Someone hacked us and is anonymously leaking all of our files on our latest project: SpaceY_Dump! We need to find out who is behind it. Can you get us their name and email so we can stop them from leaking our files?

This is all of the information that we have about the leak: https://twitter.com/0hd4y53c/status/1025761671778689024.

Flag format UMDCTF-{firstName_lastName_email}.

Everything inside the brackets should be in lower case.
