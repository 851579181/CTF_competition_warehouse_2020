easy_PEasy.exe was pulled back by your team during a pentest of a very wealthy client. It is believed that this program is an Intel x86_64 executable file, and holds the flag that is required by the client in order to prove penetration and guarantee the $1M payment.

However, while downloading the file from the target's network, they suffered massive connectivity issues! Those always happen at the worst times :( Not having adequate redundancy in place, the file came back corrupted. All of the bytes were finally recovered, but some of them are still wrong.

The team is relying on you to figure out the remaining issues so that everyone can get paid!
