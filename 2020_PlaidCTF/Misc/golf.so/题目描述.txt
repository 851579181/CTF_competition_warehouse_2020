Story
Thinking that Bovik’s flags might be hidden in plain sight, you find on your minimap of the Inner Sanctum that there’s a golf course tucked into the northeast corner. Before other people catch on to the idea, you sneak off towards the rolling grassy hills of the golf course.

As you walk up to the entrance, a small man with pointy ears pops up out of the ground.

“Would you like to play? Right now almost nobody is here, so it’ll only be a thousand checkers to play a round.“

You wave your hand and send the man the required amount. It’s not a lot of money, but your balance dwindles to a paltry sum.

“Thanks! Enjoy your game.“

A golf club appears in your hand along with a ball that looks suspiciously too large. The start of the first hole beckons, and you stride over to tee off.
