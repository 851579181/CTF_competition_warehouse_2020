Story
After all your searching within the inner sanctum, you turn your attention to the huge trees surrounding it. You take a second to marvel at their greatness. The roots tangle around each other in a seemingly endless clump, and some even stick up into the tangle of branches above. One sticks out there, disappears a moment later, only to reappear several feet further on. Some stick up, only to terminate abruptly in what looks like a cauterized wound. Others stick up and then merge into a different branch higher up the tree. You can’t really tell where one tree ends and the next tree begins. They form a most impenetrable wall around the inner sanctum, with only the one entrance.

Trying to find another flag, you decide to trace a branch and see where the log takes you. You feel a pattern you weren’t expecting underneath your fingers as they brush along the bark. It’s writing! Age has mangled the script, so you can barely make out the hint.
