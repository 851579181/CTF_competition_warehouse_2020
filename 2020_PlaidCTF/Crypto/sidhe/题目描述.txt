Story
Feeling a little down on your luck and wondering where the next flag is going to be, you sit down to take a break. You’ve made a lot of progress so far, but it seems like there’s still going to be a lot of flags left to find. You lower your head to rub it with your hands, and play with your hair a little. It’s easy enough to mess up, but you bought the auto-hair-fixer a while back in a moment of weakness.

“Hello, dearest. You’re looking a little down. How can I pick you up?”

You look up and see no one. The voice sounded warm and friendly, but you can’t see anyone around. Out of the corner of your eye, you spot a fluttering bird. Except its wings are gossamer like those of a dragonfly. And its body looks like a tiny human.

“Huh? Who are you?”

“Dearie, I’m your sidhe godmother, here to help you with your flag hunting. Let me give you some advice. The first thing you need to know is that …”

Apparently, your fairy godmother is a lecturer. You pretend to pay attention for way too long, before you are fed up with all the talking.

“It would be a lot easier if you were a genie. Then, I wouldn’t need to hear this whole lecture”, you snap.

“Well, I never! How could … Why did … If you want a genie, then fine. Deal with your genie.”

A lamp falls into your lap, and you give it a rub. Nothing happens. You rub it some more. Nothing happens. You try rubbing it with your shirt, with your pants, with a leaf you find on the ground. Nothing. You peer into the spout of the lamp and then give it a listen. You can just barely hear a faint noise coming out.
