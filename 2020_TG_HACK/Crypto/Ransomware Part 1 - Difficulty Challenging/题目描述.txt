Someone managed to get themselves infected and had ransomware running on their computer, encrypting a directory containing some important files before deleting itself from the system. We were not able to extract the actual ransomware binary, only an object file left behind in the /tmp directory. Luckily, we were capturing the current network traffic.

Are you able to decrypt the encrypted files for us?

WARNING: The ransomware object file is part of actual ransomware which WILL encrypt and delete your files if linked and executed, which without the key are lost!
