One of our agents on the ship recovered this file from a usb-stick found in the pockets of a space bandit. It appears that the space bandits are fans of an antique series of video games. We suspect there might be a flag hidden here. Have a look?

Hint
There are many ways to hide data in images, try to google the most common methods and tools used.

Other hint
Remember to surround the flag with "TG20", so that the delivered flag is "TG20{"flag you found"}"

The flag may or may not be split into two or more pieces. The final flag should be put together to form a full sentence.
