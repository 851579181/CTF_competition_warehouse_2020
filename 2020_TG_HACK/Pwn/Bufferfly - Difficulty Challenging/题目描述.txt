We've been hunting the space goblins for quite some time now. However, we're still having some trouble identifying their leader. In our last mission, we found a mysterious-looking chest that we think might contain some useful information. Could you help us open it?

nc bufferfly.tghack.no 6002
or use a mirror closer to you:

nc us.bufferfly.tghack.no 6002 (US)
nc asia.bufferfly.tghack.no 6002 (Japan)

Hint
It might be a good idea to read up on buffer overflows(https://19.tghack.no/page/Pwntions%20tutorial)

Hint
Mprotect is a very useful function that can be used to make areas of memory executable.
