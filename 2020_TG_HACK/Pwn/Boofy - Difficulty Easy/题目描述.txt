This program looks like it's password protected, but we can't seem to find the correct password.

nc boofy.tghack.no 6003

or use a mirror closer to you:

nc us.boofy.tghack.no 6003 (US)
nc asia.boofy.tghack.no 6003 (Japan)

Hint:It looks like this program has a buffer overflow vulnerability. You can read more here(https://19.tghack.no/page/Pwntions%20tutorial) or google it!
