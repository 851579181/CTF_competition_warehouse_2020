Few days ago I was checking some old backups and found a weird program that was written by me long time ago.

It was compiler... kind of... actually I really can't believe it works.

I've also found some sample programs "compiled" by this abomination, unfortunately without the sources. One of them looks to be pretty complicated and asks for password.

Could you find the password for me?
