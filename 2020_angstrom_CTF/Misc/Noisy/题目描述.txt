My furrier friend tried to send me a [morse code message](https://files.actf.co/31b6c463e0bca59873d1407e2936f72f2b64d801ad8d9cdd23c3d47fe140695d/4ea.txt) about some new furs, but he was using a noisy connection.
I think he repeated it a few times but I still can't tell what he said, could you figure out what he was trying to tell me? [Here](https://files.actf.co/067cb755364164fb95f47eb729b54e3cd1c2b1eec75d8a19cc732dc85f654ac8/Noisey.py)'s the code he used.
