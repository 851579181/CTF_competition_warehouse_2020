The evil organizers aplet and kmh are clearly up to something, but they are using the Ko-Lee key exchange! It seems that they are using the Rubik's Cube as their group. The readable part of their conversations is linked [here](https://files.actf.co/541b3cbdd99a1cb71da1c74c49401aaba5d33003908b83a9d8d114a5e9c7f946/transcript.txt).

Help me find the key! (Put the position into the cube solver and invert to get the scramble; then wrap the scramble without spaces in actf{}. If the outputted solve was R U R' U', the flag would be actf{URU'R'}.)
