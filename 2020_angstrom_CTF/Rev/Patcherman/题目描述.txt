Oh no! We were gonna make this an easy challenge where you just had to run the binary and it gave you the flag, but then clam came along under the name of "The Patcherman" and edited the binary! I think he also touched some bytes in the header to throw off disassemblers. [Can you still retrieve the flag?](https://files.actf.co/f642a4198345975a52f88ee9ec3a5753f36a154e2ea9e9db03d8351e9bbad58f/patcherman)

Alternatively, find it on the shell server at `/problems/2020/patcherman/`.
