After making that trainwreck of a criminal database site, clam decided to move on and make a [library book manager](https://files.actf.co/e30d6d3dd83faaeb47dbe49642386c8c5fa2d39f3a948889ff7a2d8cdc39a365/library_in_c) ... but written in C ... and without any actual functionality. What a fun guy. I managed to get the [source](https://files.actf.co/ffd37383709a2617e404add43fce7fafc68d03dbe4804b95a43e4ad6308bd6bb/library_in_c.c) and a copy of [libc](https://files.actf.co/74ca69ada4429ae5fce87f7e3addb56f1b53964599e8526244fecd164b3c4b44/libc.so.6) from him as well.

Find it on the shell server at `/problems/2020/library_in_c`, or over tcp at `nc shell.actf.co 20201`.
